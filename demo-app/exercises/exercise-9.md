# Exercise 9

## Requirements

1. Create a new component named Car Edit Row. The Car Edit Row is similar to Car View Row except the columns for make, model, year, color and price are input fields. When the Car Edit Row is displayed, prepopulate the fields with the data of the car being edited. Do not make the Id an input field. In the last column, there should be two buttons: save and cancel. Do not implement the logic to do the save and cancel, but display the buttons. The Car View Row is not a child component of the Car Edit Row. And, the Car Edit Row is not a child component of the Car View Row.

1. Add a button labeled Edit to the last column of the Car View Row component. When the button is clicked, the row on which it is clicked, changes to a Car Edit Row component. Only one row is editable at a time. Your data structure should only support editing one row at a time.

1. Ensure it works!
